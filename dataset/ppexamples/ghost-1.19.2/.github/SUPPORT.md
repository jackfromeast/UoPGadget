Issues which are not bug reports will be closed.

## Using Ghost(Pro)?

**Ghost(Pro)** users have access to email support via the support at ghost dot org address.

## Why not GitHub?

GitHub is our office, it's the place where our development team does its work. We use the issue list
to keep track of bugs and the features that we are working on. We do this openly for transparency.

On slack, you can leverage the knowledge of our wider community to get help with any problems you are
having with Ghost. Please keep in mind that Ghost is FLOSS, and free support is provided by the goodwill
of our wonderful community members.
